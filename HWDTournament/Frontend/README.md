# HI There and welcome to the cool frontend

This helps to create,read, and update (event, eventdetail, tournaments. EventStatus)

Also it provides real time updates of EventDetails Data. 
Meaning that whenever a value (i.e eventdetail) is being updated in database it reflects in the home page in `realtime` `without no refresh`

it uses `SignalR` to get update from whatever server/socket endpoint it is connected to.
